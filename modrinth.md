Clockwise from the top these are: Akashic Record Block, Hex Pickaxe, Frogi, Amethyst Cluster, Furnace, Summon Lightning Pattern, A minecraft player, A lime bed. The 2nd section is selected and has a tooltip containing hex patterns for a tunnel making hex labeled Tunneler. The caster is holding a dark oak staff with a dyed green leather-y bit and a dyed green covered spellbook.](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/wheel.png?raw=true)

*The features in this section work client side even without HexGloop being installed on the server.*

- **Pattern rendering** - patterns will render as they're drawn instead of `HexPattern(Direction, AngleSignature)`. You can also type these in chat and on signs and whatnot.
- **Spellbook Wheels** - a radial menu for quickly navigating your spellbook and switching pages. There is a keybind for opening the menu and pages can be selected with the mouse or number keys. (*page labeling requires the mod to be installed on the server*)
- **Scrolling Keybinds** - Keybinds that replicate the shift scrolling action that hex items, such as spellbooks and abaci, use. 
- **Open HexBook Keybind** - Keybind for opening your hex notebook while casting for quick reference.
- **Media and Pigment Tooltips** - tooltips indicating how much media certain items are worth and what pigments would look like to internalize.
