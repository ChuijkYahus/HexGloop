### **Client Side Features**

![A screenshot of the spellbook radial menu with 8 sections. Each section has an icon. Clockwise from the top these are: Akashic Record Block, Hex Pickaxe, Frogi, Amethyst Cluster, Furnace, Summon Lightning Pattern, A minecraft player, A lime bed. The 2nd section is selected and has a tooltip containing hex patterns for a tunnel making hex labeled Tunneler. The caster is holding a dark oak staff with a dyed green leather-y bit and a dyed green covered spellbook.](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/wheel.png?raw=true)

*The features in this section work client side even without HexGloop being installed on the server.*

</center>

- **Pattern rendering** - patterns will render as they're drawn instead of `HexPattern(Direction, AngleSignature)`. You can also type these in chat and on signs and whatnot.
- **Spellbook Wheels** - a radial menu for quickly navigating your spellbook and switching pages. There is a keybind for opening the menu and pages can be selected with the mouse or number keys. (*page labeling requires the mod to be installed on the server*)
- **Scrolling Keybinds** - Keybinds that replicate the shift scrolling action that hex items, such as spellbooks and abaci, use. 
- **Open HexBook Keybind** - Keybind for opening your hex notebook while casting for quick reference.
- **Media and Pigment Tooltips** - tooltips indicating how much media certain items are worth and what pigments would look like to internalize.

- **Hex Pickaxe** - A rather capable pickaxe, it casts when you mine with it.
- **Hex Blade** - A media edged sword, it casts when you attack with it.
- **Casting Ring** - A ring that allows you to cast without holding a staff.

### **New Aesthetic Items**

![A screenshot of a chest containing many new staves, dyed staves, dyed spellbooks, and essence stones.](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/staffsandbooks.png?raw=true)

</center>

- **New Staves** - Based off of minecraft items/materials, various media I like, and holidays !
- **Dyeable Staves** - All staves can be dyed, similarly to leather armor. Not every staff has a texture that shows the dye, but resource packs can support it.
- **Covered Spellbooks** - Just like a regular spellbook but dyeable and fireproof.
- **Essence Stones** - Allow you to capture an entity's essence and use their spawn egg colors as a pigment.
- **Gloop Dye** - Dyes dyeable items with rgb values. Works with many items from other mods.
